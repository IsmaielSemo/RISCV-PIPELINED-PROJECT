Architecture Project 1 Journal:
  On April 5, 2025:
    -	At 1:25pm, started drawing the single cycle block diagram.
    -	At 4:05pm, completed the single cycle block diagram.
  On April 6, 2025:
    - At 10am, started developing the I type instructions.
    - At 10:50am, completed a first version of shift instructions (SLLI, SRLI, SRAI).
    - At 10:52am, Started SLTI and SLTIU.
    - At 11am, finished a first version of SLTI and SLTIU.
    - At 11:03am, started to implement the three control signals (in addition to zero flag).
    - At 11:07 am, finished the zero and sign flags.
    - At 11:40am, started to route all the instructions in ALU
    - At 1pm, finished the routing of instructions in ALU.

On April 7, 2025:
  - On 3:30pm, started to develop the ALU_Control and add other instructions control signals
  - On 4:05pm, finished all R- type instruction signals and some I-type (ADDI,ANDI,SUBI)

On April 9, 2025:
  - At 11am, completed the ALU Control Unit, in addition to revising the instructions in the ALU
On April 10,2025:
  - At 1pm, started the Branch Control Unit.
  - At 2:20pm, completed the Branch Control Unit.
  - At 4pm, started general integration
  - At 5pm, finished general integration
  - Debugging from 7pm-12am.
On April 22, 2025:
  - On 3pm: Started to fix the I type instructions
  - On 3:50pm: Fixed an issue in the control unit that prevents us from reading the I type instructions
On April 23, 2025:
  - On 3:30pm, got addi, ori, andi, and xori to work. (a very silly bug was fixed that prevented them for working)
  - On 4:30pm, got sll, srl, slt, sltu, sra, slti, sltiu to work (a very silly bug was fixed)
  - On 5:10pm, I finished srai, slli, and srli (all the I type instructions properly working)
On April 24, 2025:
  - On 4pm, finished testing all the load instructions.
