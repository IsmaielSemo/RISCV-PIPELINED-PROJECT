# RISCV-PIPELINED-PROJECT
This repository will contain all the files for Arch project 1 "RISCV PIPELINED" done by Ismaiel Sabet, Koussay Jaballah, and Ahmed Elaswar

Milestone2 summary:
We were able to logically implement all the instructions ahead of the deadline, but due to our slow working pace and the fastly approaching deadline, in addition to other academic responsibilites, we were not able to complete the project in time. We couldn't get most of the instructions right, but we are sure of the logic, only bugs are present that we know we'll be able to solve in time before we start the pipelining. The instructions that we got to work are: LW,LB, LH, AND, OR, ADD, SUB, XOR, SLT, ECALL, PAUSE, BREAK, EBREAK. But as mentioned before, we are sure of the logic of the other instructions, but that there are slight bugs that are making them non-functional. Further when we tested out instructions, we tested them instruction by instruction, so we didn't implement large test cases as we wanted to see if the simple instructions will work on their own or no (therefore our provided test cases are simple).
